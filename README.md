# Context-API-useContext-hooks
There are 4 files in jsx 
1-> App.jsx
2->ComA.jsx
3->ComB.jsx
4->ComC.jsx
all are in hierarchical method.
if ComC.jsx needs some features from App.jsx then it have to pass from ComA and ComB...
and it may give error too.
So, React provide a features of Context API()
Where we directly pass the features of App.jsx to ComC.jsx.
